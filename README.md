- 👀 I’m interested in HomeAssistant, PLCs like Siemens S7-1500 and every kind of automation we can imagine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use HomeAssitant. For this I bought a HA Yellow (with PoE). I do a further training after work. I am systems integrator for automation solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Miele API, and I am looking forward working for Siemens one day.
